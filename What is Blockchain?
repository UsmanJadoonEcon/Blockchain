Blockchain is nothing more than a ledger.

Why trust blockchain?

Blockchain technology is based upon three primary pillars:
  . Decentralization,
  . Transparency,
  . Immutability.

These three pillars implement the foundational basis of "trust".

The four (4) main components of any blockchain ecosystem are as follows:

    a node application.
    a shared ledger.
    a consensus algorithm.
    a virtual machine.
    
    
Within the blockchain is the currency in which the ecosystem opperates with. 

In example, the original and first currency: BITCOIN .
